      <description>&lt;p&gt;You may recall in December 2021 the viral internet game Wordle, in which players try to guess a five letter word in 6 guesses. Each guess, they receive hints about the correctness of their current guess. The widespread popularity of Wordle led to many clones and spinoffs, one of which is called &lt;a href=&#34;https://nerdlegame.com/&#34;&gt;Nerdle&lt;/a&gt;. In Nerdle, rather than attempting to guess a word, players attempt to guess an equation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to implement my own version of Nerdle that supports equations of multiple lengths. This was my first foray into backend programming in Go. I ended up with a server that has an API endpoint for gameplay and serves a simple frontend. I also had fun implementing the equation parser in Go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;source-code&#34;&gt;Source Code&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The source code for this project is available on &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/ejyager00/nerdle&#34;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
This is what Nerdle gameplay looks like on my implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;nerdleRulesConfig.png&#34; alt=&#34;Options and rules of nerdle.&#34;&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
These are the rules and options users can configure for my Nerdle.&lt;/p&gt;
